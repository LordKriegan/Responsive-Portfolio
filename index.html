					<p class="pContent">Hello! My name is Qamar Abbas Stationwala. Most people call me Q for short, though (and cue the James Bond jokes...). I graduated from Esperanza High School in 2008.</p>

					<p class="pContent">I've always been pretty good with computers; ever since I was a kid. When I was in high school I took a VB6 class in my junior year, and HTML in my senior year. While attending college I took various programming courses, some of which include C, C++, Assembly, and Java. I have taught myself a tiny bit of Python as well.</p>  

					<p class="pContent">As far as my work history goes, I have had the same job since high school. I started as a cashier at Rite-Aid, but several years ago I was promoted to shift-supervisor. I learned a lot about working in and managing teams. The lesson I value most though working at Rite-Aid is my strong sense of work ethic.</p>

					<p class="pContent">A few of my hobbies include listening to a large variety of music, playing board and card games, and watching movies. You know... In case you were thinking of getting me anything... *nudge nudge, wink wink*</p>
